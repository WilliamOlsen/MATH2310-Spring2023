description: An interactive Calculus III course.
---

This course provides an introduction to vector calculus and assumes familiarity with techniques/concepts from Calculus I, II. Starting with the elementary geometry of two- and three-space, we develop the calculus of vector-valued functions and multi-variables. We discuss parametrized space curves, limits of multi-variables functions, derivatives and the chain rule, and multi-variable integration.

## Equity in mathematics

I do my best to incorporate research-based teaching practices in support of equity and diversity within mathematics. Listed below are a few links which I've found useful and enlightening:
  - [Spectra out and ally list](http://lgbtmath.org/)
  - [Behaviors academics should avoid completely](https://sites.google.com/view/basac-training/)
  - [Mathematically Gifted and Black](https://mathematicallygiftedandblack.com/)
  - [Indigenous mathematicians](https://indigenousmathematicians.org/)
  - [Lathisms](https://www.lathisms.org/)
