### Partial derivatives

An animation of the tangent line to the space curve lying on the surface $f(x,y) = x^{2} - y^{2}$. The slope of the tangent line at each point is the value of the partial derivative $f_{x} = \partial f / \partial x$ at that point.

### Directional Derivatives

An interactive plot of the directional derivative. Feel free to rotate the surface around in three-space to see that the gradient is always orthogonal to the surface.
