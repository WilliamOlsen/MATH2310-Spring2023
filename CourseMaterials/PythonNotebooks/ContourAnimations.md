###  Hyperbolic paraboloid

The graph and contour lines of the two-variable function $ z = x^{2} - y^{2} $ are shown below.

#### A family of contour lines

An animation of the family of contour lines corresponding to $ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y = k\} $ as $k$ varies from a large negative number to a large positive number.

#### Another perspective

Several parallel translates of the $xy$-plane are shown. They each intersect the graph $z = f(x,y)$ along a collection of space curves. The contour lines are obtained by projecting these space curves onto the $xy$-plane.

### A more complicated surface

Here are the contour curves of a more generic surface.

It's interesting to compare the graph $z = f(x,y)$ with that of the gradient vector field $\nabla f$.
