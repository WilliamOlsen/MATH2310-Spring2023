### A gradient vector field

Two images of the gradient vector field associated to the function $f(x,y) = (x^{2} + y^{2})\exp(x^{2} + y^{2})$.

Another depiction of the gradient vector field, this time including the contour lines.

Finally, an image of the graph of $z = f(x,y)$ along with the gradient vector field in its domain. I'm not sure why it's wobbly.

### Another gradient vector field

We're taking a look at another gradient vector field of a complicated function.
