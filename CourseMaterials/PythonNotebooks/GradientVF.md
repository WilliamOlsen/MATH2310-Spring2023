### A gradient vector field

Two images of the gradient vector field associated to the function $f(x,y) = (4x^{2} + y^{2})\exp(-x^{2} - y^{2})$.

Another depiction of the gradient vector field, this time including the contour lines.

Finally, an image of the graph of $z = f(x,y)$ along with the gradient vector field in its domain.
